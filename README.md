# xaikit - Your eXplainable AI toolkit!

xaikit is a Python package implementing a selection of eXplainable AI (XAI) algorithms.
It roughly follows the methods described in the [Explanatory Model Analysis](https://github.com/pbiecek/ema)
book by P. Biecek and T. Burzykowski.

The aim of this project is to provide a set of well-documented XAI algorithms,
together with a simple pipeline for model deployment and analytics.

The package is very much work in progress.
